# Stylus Plugin for DocPad
Adds support for the [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) CSS pre-processor to [DocPad](https://docpad.org) with the [Axis CSS](http://roots.cx/axis/) framework

Convention:  `.css.styl|stylus`


## Install

```
npm install --save docpad-plugin-axis
```


## Configure

### Use [Axis CSS](https://github.com/jenius/axis)
Axis is a terse, feature-rich css library built on top of stylus. By default Axis support is enabled, but it can be disabled by setting the `useAxis` option to `false`.

This allows you to include the entire library by using:
```css
@import 'axis'
```

### Compress
By default we compress the output for all environments except the development environment. Set the `compress` option to either `true` or `false` to change this.
